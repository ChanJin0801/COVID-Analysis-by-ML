# COVID-Analysis-by-ML
Machine Learning Algorithms are presented to identify predictors for COVID-19 deaths, new cases, and vaccinations. 
The data used in the analysis was drawn from Johnâ€™s Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard. 
For COVID-19 deaths, a K-Means model identified the best predictors to be people aged 65 or older and the cardiovascular death rate of a country. 
For COVID-19 new cases and vaccina-tions, a linear regression model only identified predic-tors to be total cases and total deaths.
